/**
 @brief DraugiemSDK provides methods for integrating with draugiem.lv.
 @discussion You should always use the shared instance when working with the SDK.
 
 All DraugiemSDK methods require appKey and appID properties to be set to valid values.
 You may manage your draugiem.lv application here: https://www.draugiem.lv/applications/dev/myapps/
 
 All DraugiemSDK external actions require that you specify at least one URL scheme for your app in
 the .plist file of your project. The scheme expected by DraugeimSDK has to mathch the template of dr[appID] (your applications identificator prefixed with "dr"). This scheme is used when performing callbacks from native Draugiem iOS app or Safari web browser.
