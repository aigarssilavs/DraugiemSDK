     When the user has successfully authenticated you may use their apiKey for integrating with your own web backend as you see fit. Note that apiKey may become invalid with time - if users password is changed for instance.

#pragma mark - Saving & Loading API key

 You may manage the API key however you see fit. We recommend saving the API key, after a successful login, so that the user wouldn't have to log in each time the app is restarted.
 
 The most obvous options for preserving the apiKey are:
 1) Save it using keychain
 2) Save it using your web service.
 
 We provide an example of saving, deleting and restoring it using apple keychain. In this example we use a keychain wrapper provided by apple. https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/GenericKeychain
